# The Shed Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The Shed is a practice tool for freelance musicians with audio, video, notes, and setlists all in one place. A freelance musician has to learn many songs throughout his or her career. Instead of listening to songs on a media player in one application, taking notes in another, and searching YouTube for different versions of a song, The Shed is a one stop shop to increase productivity and reinforce tune learning for future reference. A user can upload an audio file that is stored in AWS S3 cloud storage, take notes on the song, add bands and artists to his of her profile, build setlists for gigs, and query YouTube for individual songs. This frontend directory uses React.js for a responsive UI experience.
